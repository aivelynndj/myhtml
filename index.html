<center><p> It's almost two months since Malaysia has been quarantine and i'm one of those Sabahans that are stuck in their hostel. I'm currently in UITM, Kuching since the first phase restricted 
movement order in Malaysia. I didn't want to go back because i didn't want to take the high risk of getting affected of the virus, so i'm avoiding crowded places such as airports.
To be honest, i really do wish i was with my family right now but i think i need to sacrifice this to make sure of everyone's safe. Right? </p> 

<p> Everyday is the same for me, nothing interesting to do since we have limited things here. Basically i'm doing the same thing over and over again everyday which is sleep, eating,
play with my phone, watching korean dramas and movies, video calling with my close friends and family and that's it. In this situation, i admit i'm having a hard time trying to 
stay positive. But when i look at everything, it's amazing how God helps me by giving me good friends to lean on to, good foods and a place to stay. I'm thankful for that. </p> 

<p> The only thing that concern me the most is that i had terrible insomnia that sometimes i feel the urge to eat medicine just to get the sleepy effect of it. It's suck that i have
nothing productive to do to keep myself busy and tired. Honestly, i ran out of positive things to tell myself and i'm mentally and emotionally drained. But i think everyone that's
stuck in their hostel faced the same problem as me. So it's okay. I just hope things will get better soon so that we can back to our normal days. </p> </center>

<center> <p> It's the third phase of restricted move order and UITM finally back with online classes. At least i have something productive to do other than scrolling through 
my phone the whole day. </center> </p>

<center> <p> It's the end of my RMO routine. I hope everything will get better soon and we finally can reunite with our family that are far away without the fear of getting infected and becoming
a carrier to our loved ones. Together we fight and end this pandemic. Malaysia, we can do this! </center> </p>
